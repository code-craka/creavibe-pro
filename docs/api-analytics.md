# API Token Analytics Documentation

## Overview

The API Token Analytics system provides comprehensive insights into API usage patterns, performance metrics, and anomaly detection. This documentation covers the main features and how to use them effectively.

## Basic Analytics

The basic API Token Analytics dashboard provides:

- Request volume tracking
- Success/error rate monitoring
- Latency measurements
- Usage trends over time
- Endpoint popularity analysis

### Usage

1. Navigate to Settings > API Tokens
2. View the Analytics tab for basic metrics
3. Use the filters to select specific tokens or date ranges
4. Export data as needed for further analysis

## Advanced Analytics

The Advanced Analytics features include:

- Predictive usage forecasting
- Scenario planning for capacity management
- Competitive analysis against industry benchmarks
- Detailed performance breakdowns

### Predictive Analytics

The predictive analytics module uses machine learning to forecast future API usage based on historical patterns. This helps with capacity planning and resource allocation.

### Scenario Planning

Create and analyze different usage scenarios to prepare for various business events:
- Marketing campaigns
- New product launches
- Seasonal traffic variations
- Infrastructure changes

### Competitive Analysis

Compare your API performance against industry benchmarks and competitors:
- Feature comparison
- Performance metrics
- Market positioning
- Opportunity identification

## Anomaly Detection

The Anomaly Detection system automatically identifies unusual patterns in API usage that might indicate issues or security concerns.

### Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of usage patterns
- Automatic detection of unusual behavior
- Configurable sensitivity and thresholds
- Detailed alerts with contextual information
- Historical anomaly tracking

### Types of Anomalies Detected

1. **Request Volume Anomalies**: Sudden spikes or drops in API requests
2. **Error Rate Anomalies**: Unusual increases in error responses
3. **Latency Anomalies**: Performance degradation beyond normal patterns
4. **Geographic Anomalies**: Unusual access patterns from specific regions
5. **Usage Pattern Anomalies**: Abnormal API usage sequences or behaviors

### Configuration

You can configure the anomaly detection system to match your specific needs:

1. **Sensitivity Level**: Adjust how sensitive the system is to potential anomalies
2. **Thresholds**: Set custom thresholds for different types of anomalies
3. **Notifications**: Configure how and when you want to be alerted
4. **Learning Period**: Set how much historical data to use for establishing baselines

### Responding to Anomalies

When an anomaly is detected:

1. Review the details in the Alerts tab
2. Investigate the underlying cause using the provided context
3. Take appropriate action based on the severity and type
4. Mark as resolved once addressed
5. Provide feedback to improve future detection accuracy

## Best Practices

1. Regularly review analytics to understand usage patterns
2. Set up alerts for critical thresholds
3. Use predictive analytics for capacity planning
4. Create scenarios for major business events
5. Configure anomaly detection sensitivity based on your risk tolerance
6. Export and archive data for long-term trend analysis
7. Use insights to optimize API performance and resource allocation
